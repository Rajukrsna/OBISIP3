hello guys. this is my temperature converter website where i have created the tool using backend languages (node.js, express.js, EJS).
Also this is my first experience in creating a backend of a website using javascript. till then i used only html and css to design the websites.
Things done in this task:
created a box that asks the user about his wish of conversion:i.e, from celius to farenheit and vice versa
when the user clicks upon the button he is directed to another page where it asks to enter the temperature for conversion. 
after the user enters the temperature , he clicks convert and the final conversion is displayed below the box itself.
I have used EJS templating and partials to render different pages when the user clicks the button
I have written the server code using node.js.There i have rendered the ejs template using get and post method.
i have used local host 3000 to run the website.
